## exercise description
In this last exercise, your task is to write a query that provides the following result table:

* Renaname bookid as Book ID (note the white space and capitalised letters)
* Add the explanatory columns with the same, capitalised names.
* Order by bookid
* The column "Discount price" shows the price of the book with 5 subtracted. That is, the price minus 5, so that a book that costs 20 gets 15 as its new price.

(Hint: see the last example in 13.1.3)
